dead_simple_self_learning: A lightweight library for LLM self-improvement through feedback

This library allows any LLM agent to self-improve through feedback without retraining.
It provides a simple, transparent way to apply historical feedback to new tasks.
Supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations for better performance in I/O-bound contexts.

Key components:
- SelfLearner: Core class that manages feedback application
- Memory: Handles persistent storage of feedback
- Embedder: Generates embeddings for semantic similarity matching

Version: 0.1.0
